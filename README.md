# ðŸ©» Bone Fracture Diagnosis

This project uses a **fine-tuned EfficientNetV2** model to classify **bone fractures** across **12 categories** using X-ray images. The project demonstrates **transfer learning**, image preprocessing, and **model optimization** to achieve improved classification accuracy.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Model:** EfficientNetV2 (Pretrained)
- **Data:** X-ray images (classified into 12 types of fractures)
- **Techniques:** 
    - Transfer Learning
    - Fine-tuning
    - Data Augmentation
    - Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix)
